\title{Close the AIS WebSocket Stream}
\usage{
close_ais_stream()
}
\value{
Invisibly returns `TRUE` if a connection was closed, `FALSE` otherwise.
}
\description{
This function closes the active AIS WebSocket connection.
}
\details{
The `close_ais_stream()` function attempts to close the WebSocket connection
gracefully. It looks for the connection object in the `.aisstream_env`
environment. If the connection was started with automatic reconnection
or a heartbeat enabled, these will also be cancelled.
}
